# Running-A-Local-HTTP-Server
## Introduction
Some HTML files can be opened directly as a local file by simply double-clicking and opening it on the user's default browser. However, some cannot be opened directly due to many reasons, such as:

1. Featuring asynchronous requests due to security restrictions
2. Featuring server-side languages like Python that requires a special server
3. Including other files that may trigger a [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) error

This tutorial will illustrate three ways to locally host an HTTP server in order test and run the HTML file.

**Step 5.** Right-click the HTML file displayed in the Explorer tab or right-click inside the body of the HTML file, and there is an option that says "Open with Live Server". Click on it, and you can now run your HTML file in a locally live server!
